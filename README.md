# Mesoscale Network Models

This repository contains various mesoscale network models for studying mechanical properties of elastomeric materials.

All projects utilize the opensource [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) MD codebase, under the custom [meso-network](https://github.com/SoftMatterLab24/lammps/tree/meso-network) branch. Please see the Installing LAMMPS section for more guidance.

## Branches
Code for specific models can be found within the following branches

- **Poly** -- Elastic networks with polydispersity
- **Visco** -- Viscoelastic networks with bimodal chain length distribution

## Installing & Running LAMMPS
While LAMMPS offers both Windows and Mac compatability, we recommend using a Linux environment. For Windows users the recommended option is to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). A usefull guide can be found [here](https://docs.lammps.org/Howto_wsl.html). For a Linux distribution try Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS.

### Installation Guide
**Clean installation**
1. Open a WSL terminal and navigate to the home directory or location you wish to install LAMMPS
```
cd ~
```
2. Clone the repository (SoftMatterLab24)
```
git clone https://github.com/SoftMatterLab24/lammps.git
```
3. Switch to the meso-network branch
```
cd lammps
git checkout meso-network
```
4. Make a build directory
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
5. Run cmake with proper packages (more packages can be apppended as necessary)
```
cmake -D PKG_BPM=yes -D PKG_EXTRA-FIX=yes -D PKG_GRANULAR=yes -D PKG_MISC=yes -D PKG_MOLECULE=yes -D PKG_RIGID=yes -D PKG_TNT=yes -D PKG_EXTRA-MOLECULE=yes -D PKG_COLLOID=yes -D PKG_MC=yes -D PKG_BROWNIAN=yes ../cmake
```
6. Compile lammps (enter the number of processors you have, if you donâ€™t know choose 4)
```
make -j 4
```

**To add another package after LAMMPS is built**
1. Enter your lammps build folder
2. Append the new package (you must have the period at the end!)
```
cmake -D PKG_<NAME>=on .
```
3. Rebuild LAMMPS
```
make -j 4
```

### Running LAMMPS

WIP

### Troubleshooting
Below is a list of commonly encountered issues when trying to install lammps. Before trying one of the specific solutions below, please ensure that the requisite packages are installed:
```
sudo apt install -y cmake build-essential ccache gfortran openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev \
                    libfftw3-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev python3-dev python3-pip \
                    python3-virtualenv libblas-dev liblapack-dev libhdf5-serial-dev \
                    hdf5-tools
```

**Selecting the correct C++ Compiler**

If LAMMPS fails to build following ``` make -j 8 ``` giving X error LAMMPS may not be using the correct compiler. After running ```cmake``` (Step 5) check that ```C++ Compiler:``` is set to ``` /usr/bin/c++ ``` in the build configuration, although the exact location may differ. If this is not the case:
1. Check to see if the C++ compiler is installed by running
```
which c++
```
This should return the directory location of the compiler, i.e. ``` /usr/bin/c++ ```. If it returns blank, this means C++ is either not installed or cannot be found.

2. Install the ```build-essentials``` package, which includes various compilers and development tools:
```
sudo apt install build-essential
```
Then check to see if LAMMPS compiles. Make sure to rebuild LAMMPS with ```cmake```. If this does not work then: 

3. Manually set the compiler by including the following CMAKE build option
```
-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=c++
```
This should set CMAKE to use the correct compiler during configuration.
